## Purpose of code
For WeatherPY my code will gather weather data from a sample set of cities aroiund the world. In this case I am grabbing 573 cities. This code will iterate through all of these cities and create scatterplot charts and mesaure the linear regression between Latitude and a number of variuables. These are Lat vs Max Heat, Lat vs Cloudiness, Lat vs Wind Speed and lat vs Humidity.

For VacationPy my code will plot out all the cities in that were stored in the Data Frame i created for WeatherPy. It will then sort and filter that data into cities with weather anywhere from 60 - 70 degrees F and 60 to 70 humidity and only display store those cities. My code will the pull the first hotel located in a 10000 degree radius of the cities Lat and Lon and store that data in a new Data Frame. My code will then plot the new infromation using    hvplots.pandas.
